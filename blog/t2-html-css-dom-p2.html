        <p><br><b>What is grid based design?</b><br>

      		<br>A grid based layout is simply a grid based layout. Think Grids. Then, think layouts. Boom! another lesson from Mr. Kynd. Okay fine. Grid based layouts are used as a framework for anyone designing stuff. It forms as outline of rows and columns (horizontal and vertical axis) for the designer to implement content in a structured format. This helps increase usability for the end-user as well as serving as a platform for the designer to arrange content on their design however they see fit, or in most cases, in relation to other elements on the page.<br>

      		<br><b>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</b><br>

      		<br>Responsive design is an evolution in web design. The world today views websites from different devices and screen sizes and at one point made it difficult for designers and developers to design for different screens. The responsive design hype is pushing itself as the new standard for web design by helping designers and developers build things much more efficiently and effectively by focusing on building one website for a whole range of mobile devices in mind as well as giving them the flexibility of managing their site. Adding to that, Google, the company everyone knows about and needs no introduction (unless you live under a rock, even then you can google it) has made a web standard for developers if they want to rank higher in the google searches (SEO). I personally am onboard with this responsive design hype train and will continue to advocate it so long as everyone keeps using their mobile device.  <br>

      		<br><b>What is Semantic Structure?</b><br>

      		<br>Semantic Structure is an implied meaning of a word or sentence. In terms of the Web, it serves to interpret the relationship between the computer and the user. For example; the "heading" tag invokes a requirement of a placed heading and so the user understands the requirement of this specific word in the context of an HTML document.<br>

      		<br><b>Interesting thoughts to reflect on</b><br>

      		<br>I find the evolution of web design fundamentals to be an interesting feat of achievement in the Web Development community. The fact that innovation, even in a small place can be incremental in the ease of use for everyone involved, further creating and enhancing the platform of problem solving.<br>
