      <p><br><b>What learnings did you take from this chapter?</b><br>

  		<br>Throughout reading this chapter, I couldn't help feeling uncomfortable with the idea of mindfulness, physically uncomfortable. Reading this chapter made me understand, more than anything, that mindfulness is a process. It is not something one can "automagically" feel the effects on, therefore improving their life instantly, but it seems to have this feeling of high power. I mean high power as in something one could attain mentally, if given the patience required. It's hard to explain because it isn't something that is tangible. It involves reflecting on yourself in immediate instances which should provide gratification in the ability to rationalize in the truest sense. I agree with the author in that being mindful of ones emotions overall makes a pleasant person to be around, to work with, to share things with. It's all in your ability to be self aware, to be in that very moment, to not have an agenda while accepting what has happened or is about to happen, to not judge its very existence. This part of mindfulness is what I aspire to feel. To understand more deeply. The fact that I feel uncomfortable shows my vulnerabilities in a new light, taking away, the meaning of this, there is a true intent of acknowledging this very broken emotional response.<br>

  		<br><b>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</b><br>

  		<br>Quite invigorating. I do find it challenging to block out the other mental processes but see this as a first step to something far more grand than myself. I do however want to add that there is a healthy looming amount of skepticism in the path to enlightenment. I can't begin to share with you the criticisms that wallow through my mind. I shall keep you all updated on this process.  <br>
