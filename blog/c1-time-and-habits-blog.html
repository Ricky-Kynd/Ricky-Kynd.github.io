				<br>I enjoyed my experience with the pomodoro technique and found it to be quite useful in my day to day tasks. I found there is a limit to how many sets of pomodoro you can do, which is always interesting. My current reps of pomodoro is about 6. The pomodoro app I downloaded definitely helped me in this case (I don't see how many can use this with a stopwatch checking back and forth). All in all the pomodoro technique is quite effective but I cannot help feeling bored after a while. I will say that if you use this with the right tasks it can be very useful.<br>

				<br>Now, writing goals has always been a strange concept to me. Just the fact that I have to find a piece of paper and a pen to physically write down goals makes me cringe. As you now know, I do not have a pen and a paper, I do however have a mobile phone and a laptop. Here's the thing, It just does not work! I can attest to this on several occasions where the mighty pen and paper beats these high tech gadgets. Obviously someone with more control over their impulsive decision making have the capability of using the gadgets with the simple function of typing their set of goals for the day. I on the other hand need this pen and paper in order for the "effect" to work, so to speak.<br>

				<br>It is simply amazing what writing your goals can do for your productivity. I mean, where the hell was I in that little discussion on how we should get things done, (probably somewhere playing video games that's where!). You are held accountable by what you write on this little magical paper and with that in mind you just soar singing, "I believe I can fly" until you realize that line is getting old. Well then, shall we continue? Good. Here's where it gets interesting. I found there is a trick to this little writing goal thing down. What you want to do is analyze your behavior and patterns for, say, two weeks. You'd want to do this to ensure you are completing your goals in a realistic amount of time. Perhaps a better way to put it would be to not put too much on your plate if you're not going to finish it. It's true, I thought I'd give this thing a go while putting two weeks worth of tasks in one ordinary day. I nearly collapsed under the weight of my stress. I don't recommend it. So with all these new tricks up your sleeve I think you may find yourself building an ark in no-ah time! Ha! (Genius!). So go forth my fellow people of the land and use this to build your huts and never forget the power of the mighty pen and paper.
