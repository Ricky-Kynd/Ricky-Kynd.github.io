        <br><b>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</b><br>

        <br>How did the 'process over product' redesign affect me? Well, it affected me alright. I find myself being very frustrated at a whole bunch of little and big things. One of them being the implementation of a small video file as a background. I wish I could say I'm never doing that again, but you see... It looks so freaking cool and so I found myself giving myself a pat on the back. I cannot say however that this week was a success. Having so many ideas in my wireframe, I see how this has made me more aware on how to go about building a website. Cool is well... cool but in the end, I'd rather be done on time with simple features than OH MY GAHHHHHHHHHD!! That was the point wasn't it?! You animals! Why would do such a thing. :)<br>

        <br><b>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</b><br>

        <br>Well let's just say I thought about it. I haven't tried it. I think it has high chances of giving me the "oh my, I should have tried this sooner and I cannot believe I was so stupid to not try it sooner and... Here. Take my money." outlook but believe me when I say, No one can meditate living in the house I live in. No one. Don't even ask me about it, just know you are in a good position in your life and other people may not have it as good as you. Do that for me will yah. Even Mother Theresa will walk away saying "I'm out. Screw this!". When I get out of this house though, I am onboard with sitting down awkwardly, exclaiming chants and telling the people around you what planet you visited. I have issues and I am working through them.<br>

        <br><b>Any other musings?<b><br>

        <br>That it sounds magical. I may sound negative to you but trust me...<br>

        <br><b>DID ANY OF THE SUGGESTED MEDITATION TECHNIQUES STAND OUT TO YOU?<br><b>

        <br>Yes, all of them.<br>
