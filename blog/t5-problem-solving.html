        <b>Non Tech-Friend Story Time</b><br>

        <br>Hi non tech friend, let me tell you a long winded story about something you probably don't care about and will disregard as I say it. Let's begin. There was a time, actually this morning, when I ran into a problem, the problem however is not a real problem, just a mundane task that is disguised as problems to get you super angry in less than 5 minutes. So anyway, this problem you see was quite, problematic. The problem required me to print out a chessboard onto a screen that was made out of hashtags. Go figure, friend. Here I was getting ready to tackle this problem when all of a sudden I said. What? That's it? Boy was I a fool to think this was going to be easy. You see, friend, I made a simple for loop that printed the hashTags on the screen. The problem I had for the first few minutes(hours) was to do with getting those darn tags in a row, yes, kinda like when we went duck hunting. yes, those were fun times. Anyway, so yeah, here I was not realizing that the only thing making my dang hastags not appear in a line was where my console.log() output was placed. It was in the wrong place! No, not like when you were at catherines house and you put the keys in the bottom shelf when you thought it was in second shelf you douche, well... well actually, that's actually right. Wow. Anyway (gives friend weird looks), stop cutting me off, I still have to tell you about the rest of the problem, oh, oh you're asleep. Well... Sigh. So to finish this off, I solved the problem with google, I learnt that placing console.log() after the braces produces different results?<br><br>


        <b>Reflecting on problem solving techniques</b><br>

        <br>I like to try different methods, psuedocoding is cool but I don't like giving myself false hope, console.logging, googling, sometimes asking help from my peers and probably never asked my coaches for help, but that would be awesome if they weren't so busy all the time :( just kidding, I will be pestering them when the time comes.<br><br>


        <br><b>Explain to your non-tech friend on using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words.</b><br>

         <br><b>.map() =</b> The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order<br>

         <br><b>.filter() =</b> The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).<br>

         <br><b>.reduce() =</b> The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value. The reduce() method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right). The return value of the function is stored in an accumulator (result/total).<br>
