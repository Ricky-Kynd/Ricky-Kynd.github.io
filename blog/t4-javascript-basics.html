          <b>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?<b><br>

          <br>JavaScript is simply amazing. First of all, don't get me started on the what you can do with javaScript. The amount of tools given to you to play with just makes my heart melt with joy. I found it quite hilarious thinking of how much time I'm going to spend on JavaScript in comparison to my time with CSS the other week, where things didn't go so well for the parties involved, although I had a blast. Anyway, on the technical side of things, JavaScript will provide a much more challenging experience since we are dealing with math concepts and using a lot of patience to achieve our desired goals. It really is like breathing life into a very dull HTML and CSS page.   <br>

          <br><b>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth<b><br>

          <br>Control flow is quite simply the order of set conditions and statements which are then executed in steps usually written from top to bottom. A simple example I can think of from my frustrations this morning as I write this is the insertion of my USB flash drive. Firstly one would visually or mentally prepare to insert the drive into the free port, secondly, they would make their first attempt at inserting the drive the correct way, if that doesn't work, they would move on to the third step of flipping the flash drive the other way around and inserting it to achieve their goal. commented out in that function would be stated as "the number of attempts to insert this drive varies in terms of urgency - the faster you go the bigger the mess".<br>

          <br><b>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals<b><br>

          <br>Here is a list of things you can do with an array. Nest one array with another array, access and modify array data with indexes, access multi-dimensional arryas with indexes and of course manipulate the arrays with the push, pop, shift and unshift methods. Objects on the other hand have properties and values which can be accessed with the dot operator as well as using bracket notation. You can also access object properties with variables update, add, and delete objects. These are the just the list of things you can do with arrays and objects. (and yes it was taken from the freeCodeCamp course outline). Enjoy!<br>

          <br><b>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</b><br>

          <br>Functions are a basically a block of code (a set of methods) used or called upon to perform a certain task. The reason they are so useful is because they can be reused or refactored (probably using that word wrong) with different parameters to be used in different situations to produce the desired result.<br>
