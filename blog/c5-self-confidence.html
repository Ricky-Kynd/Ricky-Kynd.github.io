      <p><b>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</b><br>
      <br>The relationship between the two is the ability to focus on ones awareness of the present moment, to not judge the emotions while acknowledging what one is feeling. This engages the person to reflect and probe deeper, to develop a more intimate understanding of their physiological responses as it occurs.<br>

     <br><b>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</b><br>

     <br>My experience with body scanning left me a little perplexed at first. I found myself sitting there and actually counting how many seconds had gone by so that I could get through to the next 2 minutes or so. I don't think it was a succesful first attempt so I figured I'd give it a go later on when perhaps the chaos in my head decided to settle. On my second attempt there was a feeling of, "oh, I see how this goes" wallowing around in my head for the first few minutes. It really is quite interesting when you give yourself the chance to really focus and pay attention to what your body is doing. Perhaps it was just my mind playing tricks on me, who knows. Journalizing on the other hand is probably my favorite way of practicing self awareness. It allows me to freely express what is going on in my head and sit there in astonishment when random (often deranged) thoughts are being read with WTF expressions on my face. Anyway, this works for the moment as I train my mind to pay more attention and reach ultimate self awareness. Sigh.<br>

     <br><b>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section</b><br>

     <br>My emotions quite simply isn't me. I understand how most people may perceive it in that way and so I agree with what the author strives to make known. I look forward to describing my feelings as being felt in the present moment rather than the feeling describing who I am.<br>
