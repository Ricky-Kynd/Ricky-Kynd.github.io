          <b>WHAT IS A RESPONSIVE SITE, AND WHY RESPONSIVENESS IS IMPORTANT?<b><br>

          <br>From what I have experienced and understand, responsive design is a mobile first approach to designing and developing websites. I find the importance of responsive site design has increased due in part to a large number of users moving their daily internet consumption to mobile devices. This is likely because of convience sake as well telecommunication companies expanding their mobile data packages as well as having competitive rates amongst other telecommunication companies. I believe this "trend" will not only expand but it has plenty of power to make desktop setups obselete. The shift for designers and developers, is only a logical one - to serve their audience with the experience they deserve or risk losing their user base. In a world as fast paced as this, it is essential for them to be on the cutting edge of user needs to stay alive. Responsive design is here to stay much until we figure out this virtual reality thing.<br>

          <br><b>WHAT IS MOBILE FIRST DESIGN, AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT?<b><br>

          <br>See above.<br>

          <br><b>WHAT ARE FRAMEWORKS, AND THEIR PROS AND CONS?<b><br>

          <br>Frameworks are the foundation to fast track a developer or designer to iterate a product and get feedback in the shortest amount of time possible. It is the essential component of small to large companies competing with the race against time. Frameworks add a layer of flexbility although at a cost. It assumes the developer or designer have a working knowledge on the fundamentals of the certain language a framework is developed in. I can attest to this on a few occasions where I've thought to myself on how easy it was to get my ideas implemented but had no idea how some elements work and more importantly, don't work. This is the crutch of these frameworks. If you have a good solid foundation (another framework) of your intended language, then you have a better time spent on developing your ideas quickly. If not, you will be amazed at how quick your ideas are implemented but frustrated like hell trying to debug what isn't working or just shrugging thinking "I have no idea how that worked but screw it, it works".<br>

          <br><b>WHAT IS A WIREFRAME AND WHY DO WE USE IT?</b><br>

          <br>Wireframe is the initial sketch of your idea you would like to implement. It is at this stage you can, iron out the ideas in your mind and really get feedback from your peers while iterating it along the way. It makes sense to use wireframing for one important reason and one reason only, (for me that is) No-one can see what you see. They do not know what you envision and so it makes it very difficult to evaluate what features are a hit or a miss. This reason alone is why wireframing works in this industry. Ideas sound and feel great in our head but on paper, you are at the whim of your audience and peers to agree or disagree with, unless of course you're a stubborn cow (as my mom calls me) and push through the negative responses and make them like it! lol<br>

          <br><b>THE ASPECTS OF MY WIREFRAME I FOUND DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT, AND WHY.</b><br>

          <br>Are you freaking kidding me. I had trouble with everything to do with the framework. I found it hilarious that most of my ideas were'nt implemented because I misjudged how long they were going to take. I have iterated so much of my wireframe ideas that it no longer looks like my wireframe, which I understand was the whole point in the first place. First of all, the framework was a pain in the ass as I'm use to freestyling certain css styles and the whole debugging experience made me a little closer to taking the life of my pet goldfish. I will say though, that the perfectionist inside of me died that day and I don't think I want him back since I already went over the assigned week and it still turned out pretty shit.<br>
