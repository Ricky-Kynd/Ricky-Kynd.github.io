				<br>The experience is quite honestly too early to shed any light on. I really like these type of institutions that encourage students to communicate and vocalize their frustrations to help alleviate any thing that is mentally blocking progress. I enjoy the experience with the other students as well as the educators and in time know that we are going to all be an unstoppable force. EDA taken from DBC have proved overall effective in their mission to educate future software developers in a controversial way. I too like them like going against the grain as I have spent most of my life doing just that. If anything I see myself diving right into the culture knowing full well what to expect.<br>

				<br>I have sat on the sidelines patiently waiting for an opportunity to further my knowledge in a concise, no nonsense kind of way, although I do enjoy taking the time out to think about things much more deeply, recently reducing my overall anxiety levels as well as rationalizing more effectively. I believe my expectations have not changed in terms of what to expect from the course. I expect something challenging which will push my mental capability to a another level and I'm sure Dev Academy will deliver on that promise. The only expectations I have is of myself. The expectation to maintain this level of passion through the tough times I hope and are willing to endure, "for one cannot improve doing the easy things" (said someone sometime). <br>

				<br>With all that said, hell yes I'm excited. I cannot wait any longer. In fact, due to my indecisiveness, I was irritated at not making this decision any sooner. I hope that by the end of this bootcamp, I will be saying to myself, "that was a no brainer, what in the hell was I on the fence about, (oh yeah money... haha well... time to make some cheddar with my new found skills. Peace!)".
