      I found this chapter very relateble. The author speaks on how to engage yourself to the understanding of self mastery by controlling your emotions, dissipating negative urges with the use of mindfulness along with self awareness. It is very interesting how this all relates to Maslow's hierarchy of needs and how self awareness is at the top of the pyramid before reaching transcendence. This chapter highly resonates with how I have come to terms of projecting myself to the world. It shows how having the self awareness of your emotions prevents the overuse of them in certain conditions where you were more likely to repeat the same mistakes. It's quite like chess when you have to understand the end game before you start playing making sure to choose the absolute best move while tossing in the human element of how your opponent is thinking and how you will react. This is just one use case of course but I find in most interactions in my daily life, applying this mentality, first of all, gets you out of a whole heap of trouble, and it limits the amount of regrets one can have from a brief conversation or interaction. It shows or proves you have mastery over yourself when you can capture the negative emotion, allowing yourself to take it's power away by reflecting on how you can slow yourself down, analyze the emotion, understand the other persons intent, not judging the persons intent in favor of ridding yourself of any regrets you are unwilling to ponder on later and choosing the best way to deal with that emotion with the triumph of mastering this one very important instance of human enlightenment.
