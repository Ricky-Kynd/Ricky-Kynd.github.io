      <p><b>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</b><br>

      <br>As with most things in this world, the only thing I can realistically compare it to is the human anatomy. The HTML is most definitely a derivative from the skeletal system while the CSS is everything to do with the appearance and layout of your body. For example skin complexion, the size, look, position of your eyes, nose, mouth, hands etc. This coupled with the analogy of the DOM (Document Object Model) being an important aspect of the three. I would compare the DOM perhaps to a surgeon. I'm still not sure why but I feel a comparison to the brain seems a bit far fetched, although it is somewhat reminiscent of the the brains functions...hmm. I will definitely have to confirm this. As for now, I shall justify my initial comparison to a Surgeon or a Doctor as they would have access to the body of your site (your physical body as well, under consent of course). Let's look it like this, it has ways for it to manipulate certain parts of the HTML system (skeletal system) as well as the CSS system (the layout and style of your body/flesh?). The Surgeon/Doctor can tell you what is broken, what needs fixing; most importantly has the ability to fix things on the go. So to conclude this very broken analogy, the HTML being the skeletal system, CSS, the perception and layout to human bodies elements and finally the doctor that checks to see if everything is okay as well as having the ability to change a few things if you're unhappy. Plastic surgeon anyone?<br>

      <br><b>What is meant by boxifying design?</b><br>

      <br>It basically means to put everything in a box layout. A rectangle or square is the most practical shape of the lot of them having the ability to hold any shape within its walls depending on the adjusted width/height. It is used in most instances to determine exactly a specific measurement of any geometrical shape or element. The term used in Web Development does not defer from this at all and uses this to its fullest extent. Why call it "Boxifying"? Because someone call dibs, that's why, and everyone else wasn't bothered enough to challenge it. Good call everyone.<br>

      <br><b>What is the box model?</b><br>

      <br>The box model is similar to the definition above except in web development, it has a few unique additions to it. Well not particularly unique. I think Architects use a similar model, last time I checked. Anyway, the use of this box model is explained quite simply by a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. Let's take a look at this closely and analyze each part. The content is basically the content of the box. It's where the text and images appear when added or styled through CSS. The padding clears an area around the content, think of the gap between your house and your fence? The border quite literally is your fence, this goes around the padding (the gap between your house and the fence) as well as the content (your house). The margin is quite a difficult element to distinguish. It's quite similar to the padding and is often confused by many people. I agree to the confusion of these two terms but I guess differentiating it by calling it a margin instead of the padding helps people understand exactly what it is and where it should be used. Anyway, onwards to our example of margin. The margin is the clearance outside your fence (the border), kind of like the gap between your next door neighbors fence and your fence (that's if you don't share fences, which most people do  in fact, this is a shitty analogy). It is important to note that padding and margin properties are transparent, meaning, you can't aesthetically see them but you'll know it's there when playing adding them. Of course my understanding of margin and padding could essentially be wrong and so I apologize in advance if it indeed is. So yeah, if you still don't understand it then well, read again, look it up yourself, talk to a few people, you know the drill. Have fun in your findings.<br>
