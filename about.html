				Well let's see...My journey really began when I turned 21. You see, before this I didn't know myself. I paid no mind to the intricacies of life. I did what people thought was right for me, though not knowing anything about me. "Well how could they?", I often ask myself. I was an introvert chugging along doing my very best to stay alive. It all sounds like a depressing start to an about me page doesn't it? Well, the story get's better. Trust me. Wait. Don't. The story isn't over yet. This is too hard. I don't think I know anything about me. Is that normal? I know what I like and what I don't like. Is that what you want to know? Whether you should find similarities or anomalies in one's life to conclude "I like this person". I see why I was an introvert. It's much safer here. I think I'll stay here. If you need me, you know where I am.<br>
				<br>Wait! Don't you dare click out of this page! or change tabs! I'm watching you. I'm kidding. I find myself entertaining to myself. In no way do I believe I am insane. If anything I am more inclined to think I am sane. Sane as one can get. Wait. That's not what sane people say. Am I really having a conversation to myself. Again?! Now I know absolutely no one will read this. Just great! Look what you did! No, Not you... I'm talking to him. Yes you. Look I'll just be a minute. Have a browse around. You know... see what you like.<br>
