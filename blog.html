		<p><br><b>What is grid based design?</b><br>

		<br>A grid based layout is simply a grid based layout. Think Grids. Then, think layouts. Boom! another lesson from Mr. Kynd. Okay fine. Grid based layouts are used as a framework for anyone designing stuff. It forms as outline of rows and columns (horizontal and vertical axis) for the designer to implement content in a structured format. This helps increase usability for the end-user as well as serving as a platform for the designer to arrange content on their design however they see fit, or in most cases, in relation to other elements on the page.<br>

		<br><b>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</b><br>

		<br>Responsive design is an evolution in web design. The world today views websites from different devices and screen sizes and at one point made it difficult for designers and developers to design for different screens. The responsive design hype is pushing itself as the new standard for web design by helping designers and developers build things much more efficiently and effectively by focusing on building one website for a whole range of mobile devices in mind as well as giving them the flexibility of managing their site. Adding to that, Google, the company everyone knows about and needs no introduction (unless you live under a rock, even then you can google it) has made a web standard for developers if they want to rank higher in the google searches (SEO). I personally am onboard with this responsive design hype train and will continue to advocate it so long as everyone keeps using their mobile device.  <br>

		<br><b>What is Semantic Structure?</b><br>

		<br>Semantic Structure is an implied meaning of a word or sentence. In terms of the Web, it serves to interpret the relationship between the computer and the user. For example; the "heading" tag invokes a requirement of a placed heading and so the user understands the requirement of this specific word in the context of an HTML document.<br>

		<br><b>Interesting thoughts to reflect on</b><br>

		<br>I find the evolution of web design fundamentals to be an interesting feat of achievement in the Web Development community. The fact that innovation, even in a small place can be incremental in the ease of use for everyone involved, further creating and enhancing the platform of problem solving.<br>

			<p><b>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</b><br>

		<br>As with most things in this world, the only thing I can realistically compare it to is the human anatomy. The HTML is most definitely a derivative from the skeletal system while the CSS is everything to do with the appearance and layout of your body. For example skin complexion, the size, look, position of your eyes, nose, mouth, hands etc. This coupled with the analogy of the DOM (Document Object Model) being an important aspect of the three. I would compare the DOM perhaps to a surgeon. I'm still not sure why but I feel a comparison to the brain seems a bit far fetched, although it is somewhat reminiscent of the the brains functions...hmm. I will definitely have to confirm this. As for now, I shall justify my initial comparison to a Surgeon or a Doctor as they would have access to the body of your site (your physical body as well, under consent of course). Let's look it like this, it has ways for it to manipulate certain parts of the HTML system (skeletal system) as well as the CSS system (the layout and style of your body/flesh?). The Surgeon/Doctor can tell you what is broken, what needs fixing; most importantly has the ability to fix things on the go. So to conclude this very broken analogy, the HTML being the skeletal system, CSS, the perception and layout to human bodies elements and finally the doctor that checks to see if everything is okay as well as having the ability to change a few things if you're unhappy. Plastic surgeon anyone?<br>

	    <br><b>What is meant by boxifying design?</b><br>

		<br>It basically means to put everything in a box layout. A rectangle or square is the most practical shape of the lot of them having the ability to hold any shape within its walls depending on the adjusted width/height. It is used in most instances to determine exactly a specific measurement of any geometrical shape or element. The term used in Web Development does not defer from this at all and uses this to its fullest extent. Why call it "Boxifying"? Because someone call dibs, that's why, and everyone else wasn't bothered enough to challenge it. Good call everyone.<br>

        <br><b>What is the box model?</b><br>

		<br>The box model is similar to the definition above except in web development, it has a few unique additions to it. Well not particularly unique. I think Architects use a similar model, last time I checked. Anyway, the use of this box model is explained quite simply by a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. Let's take a look at this closely and analyze each part. The content is basically the content of the box. It's where the text and images appear when added or styled through CSS. The padding clears an area around the content, think of the gap between your house and your fence? The border quite literally is your fence, this goes around the padding (the gap between your house and the fence) as well as the content (your house). The margin is quite a difficult element to distinguish. It's quite similar to the padding and is often confused by many people. I agree to the confusion of these two terms but I guess differentiating it by calling it a margin instead of the padding helps people understand exactly what it is and where it should be used. Anyway, onwards to our example of margin. The margin is the clearance outside your fence (the border), kind of like the gap between your next door neighbors fence and your fence (that's if you don't share fences, which most people do  in fact, this is a shitty analogy). It is important to note that padding and margin properties are transparent, meaning, you can't aesthetically see them but you'll know it's there when playing adding them. Of course my understanding of margin and padding could essentially be wrong and so I apologize in advance if it indeed is. So yeah, if you still don't understand it then well, read again, look it up yourself, talk to a few people, you know the drill. Have fun in your findings.<br>

			<h1>Time and Habits</h1>

				Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<br>
				<span class="ansa">I tried the Pomodoro technique as well as writing down goals.</span><br>
				What did you find interesting?<br>
				<span class="ansa">I found the pomodoro technique to actually work as well as writing goals.</span><br>
				What worked for you?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Both these techniques are simple and effective.</span><br>
				Which will you experiment further with?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Both the Pomodoro as well as visualizing and affirming achievement of tasks.</span><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<br>I enjoyed my experience with the pomodoro technique and found it to be quite useful in my day to day tasks. I found there is a limit to how many sets of pomodoro you can do, which is always interesting. My current reps of pomodoro is about 6. The pomodoro app I downloaded definitely helped me in this case (I don't see how many can use this with a stopwatch checking back and forth). All in all the pomodoro technique is quite effective but I cannot help feeling bored after a while. I will say that if you use this with the right tasks it can be very useful.<br>

				<br>Now, writing goals has always been a strange concept to me. Just the fact that I have to find a piece of paper and a pen to physically write down goals makes me cringe. As you now know, I do not have a pen and a paper, I do however have a mobile phone and a laptop. Here's the thing, It just does not work! I can attest to this on several occasions where the mighty pen and paper beats these high tech gadgets. Obviously someone with more control over their impulsive decision making have the capability of using the gadgets with the simple function of typing their set of goals for the day. I on the other hand need this pen and paper in order for the "effect" to work, so to speak.<br>

				<br>It is simply amazing what writing your goals can do for your productivity. I mean, where the hell was I in that little discussion on how we should get things done, (probably somewhere playing video games that's where!). You are held accountable by what you write on this little magical paper and with that in mind you just soar singing, "I believe I can fly" until you realize that line is getting old. Well then, shall we continue? Good. Here's where it gets interesting. I found there is a trick to this little writing goal thing down. What you want to do is analyze your behavior and patterns for, say, two weeks. You'd want to do this to ensure you are completing your goals in a realistic amount of time. Perhaps a better way to put it would be to not put too much on your plate if you're not going to finish it. It's true, I thought I'd give this thing a go while putting two weeks worth of tasks in one ordinary day. I nearly collapsed under the weight of my stress. I don't recommend it. So with all these new tricks up your sleeve I think you may find yourself building an ark in no-ah time! Ha! (Genius!). So go forth my fellow people of the land and use this to build your huts and never forget the power of the mighty pen and paper.

				What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Good so far.</span><br>
				What are your impressions?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Also good.</span><br>
				How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Pretty engaging mate!</span><br>
				Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Nope, only expectations of myself to work even harder.</span><br>
				Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Absolutely! (both excited and nervous)</span><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<br>The experience is quite honestly too early to shed any light on. I really like these type of institutions that encourage students to communicate and vocalize their frustrations to help alleviate any thing that is mentally blocking progress. I enjoy the experience with the other students as well as the educators and in time know that we are going to all be an unstoppable force. EDA taken from DBC have proved overall effective in their mission to educate future software developers in a controversial way. I too like them like going against the grain as I have spent most of my life doing just that. If anything I see myself diving right into the culture knowing full well what to expect.<br>

				<br>I have sat on the sidelines patiently waiting for an opportunity to further my knowledge in a concise, no nonsense kind of way, although I do enjoy taking the time out to think about things much more deeply, recently reducing my overall anxiety levels as well as rationalizing more effectively. I believe my expectations have not changed in terms of what to expect from the course. I expect something challenging which will push my mental capability to a another level and I'm sure Dev Academy will deliver on that promise. The only expectations I have is of myself. The expectation to maintain this level of passion through the tough times I hope and are willing to endure, "for one cannot improve doing the easy things" (said someone sometime). <br>

				<br>With all that said, hell yes I'm excited. I cannot wait any longer. In fact, due to my indecisiveness, I was irritated at not making this decision any sooner. I hope that by the end of this bootcamp, I will be saying to myself, "that was a no brainer, what in the hell was I on the fence about, (oh yeah money... haha well... time to make some cheddar with my new found skills. Peace!)".
