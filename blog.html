			<h1>TIME AND HABITS</h1>

				Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<br>
				<span class="ansa">I tried the Pomodoro technique as well as writing down goals.</span><br>
				What did you find interesting?<br>
				<span class="ansa">I found the pomodoro technique to actually work as well as writing goals.</span><br>
				What worked for you?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Both these techniques are simple and effective.</span><br>
				Which will you experiment further with?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Both the Pomodoro as well as visualizing and affirming achievement of tasks.</span><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<br>I enjoyed my experience with the pomodoro technique and found it to be quite useful in my day to day tasks. I found there is a limit to how many sets of pomodoro you can do, which is always interesting. My current reps of pomodoro is about 6. The pomodoro app I downloaded definitely helped me in this case (I don't see how many can use this with a stopwatch checking back and forth). All in all the pomodoro technique is quite effective but I cannot help feeling bored after a while. I will say that if you use this with the right tasks it can be very useful.<br>
				<br>Now, writing goals has always been a strange concept to me. Just the fact that I have to find a piece of paper and a pen to physically write down goals makes me cringe. As you now know, I do not have a pen and a paper, I do however have a mobile phone and a laptop. Here's the thing, It just does not work! I can attest to this on several occasions where the mighty pen and paper beats these high tech gadgets. Obviously someone with more control over their impulsive decision making have the capability of using the gadgets with the simple function of typing their set of goals for the day. I on the other hand need this pen and paper in order for the "effect" to work, so to speak.<br>
				<br>It is simply amazing what writing your goals can do for your productivity. I mean, where the hell was I in that little discussion on how we should get things done, (probably somewhere playing video games that's where!). You are held accountable by what you write on this little magical paper and with that in mind you just soar singing, "I believe I can fly" until you realize that line is getting old. Well then, shall we continue? Good. Here's where it gets interesting. I found there is a trick to this little writing goal thing down. What you want to do is analyze your behavior and patterns for, say, two weeks. You'd want to do this to ensure you are completing your goals in a realistic amount of time. Perhaps a better way to put it would be to not put too much on your plate if you're not going to finish it. It's true, I thought I'd give this thing a go while putting two weeks worth of tasks in one ordinary day. I nearly collapsed under the weight of my stress. I don't recommend it. So with all these new tricks up your sleeve I think you may find yourself building an ark in no-ah time! Ha! (Genius!). So go forth my fellow people of the land and use this to build your huts and never forget the power of the mighty pen and paper.

				What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Good so far.</span><br>
				What are your impressions?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Also good.</span><br>
				How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Pretty engaging mate!</span><br>
				Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Nope, only expectations of myself to work even harder.</span><br>
				Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<br>
				<span class="ansa">Absolutely! (both excited and nervous)</span><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<br>The experience is quite honestly too early to shed any light on. I really like these type of institutions that encourage students to communicate and vocalize their frustrations to help alleviate any thing that is mentally blocking progress. I enjoy the experience with the other students as well as the educators and in time know that we are going to all be an unstoppable force. EDA taken from DBC have proved overall effective in their mission to educate future software developers in a controversial way. I too like them like going against the grain as I have spent most of my life doing just that. If anything I see myself diving right into the culture knowing full well what to expect.<br> <br>I have sat on the sidelines patiently waiting for an opportunity to further my knowledge in a concise, no nonsense kind of way, although I do enjoy taking the time out to think about things much more deeply, recently reducing my overall anxiety levels as well as rationalizing more effectively. I believe my expectations have not changed in terms of what to expect from the course. I expect something challenging which will push my mental capability to a another level and I'm sure Dev Academy will deliver on that promise. The only expectations I have is of myself. The expectation to maintain this level of passion through the tough times I hope and are willing to endure, "for one cannot improve doing the easy things" (said someone sometime). <br> <br>With all that said, hell yes I'm excited. I cannot wait any longer. In fact, due to my indecisiveness, I was irritated at not making this decision any sooner. I hope that by the end of this bootcamp, I will be saying to myself, "that was a no brainer, what in the hell was I on the fence about, (oh yeah money... haha well... time to make some cheddar with my new found skills. Peace!)".
